From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record):

> Records of global average surface temperature are usually presented as anomalies rather than as absolute temperatures. A temperature anomaly is measured against a reference value or long-term average. For example, if the reference value is 15 °C, and the measured temperature is 17 °C, then the temperature anomaly is +2 °C (i.e., 17 °C -15 °C).

And from [Global Surface Temperature Anomalies](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/anomalies.php)

> The term _temperature anomaly_ means a departure from a reference value or long-term average. A positive anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was warmer than the reference value, while a negative anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was cooler than the reference value.

In this line chart visualization, data for the Global, the Northern and Southern Hemispheres annual mean temperature changes is shown from 1880 to present where the anomalies shown are relative to the 1951-80 reference period means. The blue line describes the data for the Northern Hemisphere, the red for the Southern Hemisphere, and the black line is for the Globe.
